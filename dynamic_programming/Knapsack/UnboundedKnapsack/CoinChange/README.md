This is basically like subset sum but the differnce is we can choose the same element multiple times

The code would be the same as count subset sum...only instead of i-1 we would send i since there is no bound


## Type 2 - Minimum No. Of Coins

Out of all the possible ways to obtain the sum we have to find the way which has minimum number of coins
