# Knapsack Problem

Three types of knapsack problems in total

1) Fractional Knapsack
2) 0-1 Knapsack
3) Unbounded Knapsack

Fractional Knapsack -> Items can be filled in partially,and its value would have the same effect(suppose half of the item is filled,so its value will also be halved.) -> Solved Using

0-1 Knapsack -> Either the item would go fully in (1) or won't go in at all(0), here partitions are not allowed like in the case of fractional knapsack

Unbounded Knapsack -> There is no limit on supply of items
