# Longest Repeating Subsequence

Given a string,we have to print length of such sequence which is longest and repeats

Here we would duplicate the given string and use LCS on the two same strings...only difference here would be....when we are selecting the character, we'll add a condition that i!=j(we can't use the same character in repeating sequence)
