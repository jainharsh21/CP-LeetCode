# Print Longest Common Subsequence

Here first solve it same as the finding the length of common subsequence...
After the matrix is formed...run the loop till either of the looping variables are 0(that'll mean either of the string became empty)

Now traverse back the path that was chosen while finding the length...and if there is a match of characters add that character to the solution variable...and in the end return the reverse of that variable
